# Secant-Method
The secant method is a technique used in numerical analysis to locate roots of secant lines in order to more accurately approximation the root of a function f. Here, Code of Secant Method of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language.
# Project title

Secant Method


## Motivation

A University Assignment. Clearly Used to Solve anhy Porblem and Perform Computer Oriented Prolblems .


## Method and results

The secant method procedures are given below using equation (1).

Step 1: Initialization
x0 and x1 of α are taken as initial guesses.

Step 2: Iteration
In the case of n = 1, 2, 3, …,

until a specific criterion for termination has been met (i.e., The desired accuracy of the answer or the maximum number of iterations has been attained).
